                <ul>
                    <li>1 large ripe banana (around 150g)</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp fine salt</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil, plus extra for cooking</li>
                    <li>120g self-raising flour</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
                    <li>150 ml oat, almond milk or soya milk</li>
                    <li>Syrup, sliced banana and berries, to serve (optional)</li>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mash the banana in aÂ mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and oil. Add the flour and baking powder and mix thoroughly. Make a well in the centre and gradually whisk in the milk. The batter should be a thick, droppable consistency.</li>
                    <li>Heat a little oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add 2 tbsp of the batter to make American-style pancakes. You will be able to make about 4-5 at a time. Fry on each side for 2-3 mins until golden. Serve with syrup, sliced banana and berries, if you like.</li>
