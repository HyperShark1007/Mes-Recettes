                    <li>2 large floury potatoes (400g), cut into chips</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>For the mushy peas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>200g frozen peas</li>
                    <li>2 spring onions, trimmed and chopped</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp chopped mint</li>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat the oven to 200℃ / 180℃ fan / gas 6. Line a baking sheet with a sheet of foil and rub with a few drops of rapeseed oil. For the chips, toss the oil with the prepared potatoes, then spread over the baking sheet in a single layer and bake for 30-40 mins until golden. After 20 mins, add the tomatoes or cook on a second baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, make the mushy peas. Boil the peas and spring onions in a pan for 5 mins until tender. Drain, reserving some of the cooking water. Tip the peas and spring onions into a bowl with the mint and 2 tbsp of the reserved water, then blitz using a hand blender until smooth. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>To prepare the fish, whisk the beaten egg, ground almonds and gram flour together with a little seasoning - it doesn’t need to be completely smooth. Heat the 1 tbsp oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Stir the baking powder into the batter mixture and quickly coat the cod loins on both sides. Fry for 3 mins on one side, then spoon over any coating left in the bowl, turn it and fry for another 3 mins until golden and cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Warm the mushy peas in the microwave if needed, then serve with the fish, chips and tomatoes. </li>
                </ul>
