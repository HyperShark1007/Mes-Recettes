                    <li>85g watercress, chopped</li>
                    <li>4 tbsp crème fraîche</li>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mix the flour, a pinch of salt and the butter in a bowl, then stir in the cheese. Blend 2 tbsp cold water with the mustard and stir in. Form into a dough. Wrap and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Heat the butter and oil in a pan and fry the chicken for 5 mins until golden. Add the leeks and fry for 2-3 mins until softened. Add the stock, bring to the boil then cover and simmer gently for 15 mins.</li>
                    <li>Heat the oven to 200℃ / 180℃ fan / gas 6. Transfer the chicken and leeks to a 1-2 litre pie dish with a slotted spoon - leave the stock in the pan on a low heat.</li>
                    <li>Mix the flour and 1 tbsp cold water together to form a paste. Thin with 2 tbsp stock, then add to the pan with the rest of the stock and stir non-stop until thickened. Take off the heat, stir in the watercress and crème fraîche, season and pour over the chicken and leeks.</li>
                    <li>Roll out the pastry between 2 pieces of cling film until just larger than the dish. Remove the top piece of film and lift the pastry onto a rolling pin with the cling film underneath. Lay pastry-side down over the filling. Peel away the film, then trim around the rim. Make a small hole in the centre. Brush the pastry with milk. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden.</li>
